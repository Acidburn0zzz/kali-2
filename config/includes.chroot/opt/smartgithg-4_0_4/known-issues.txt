Known Issues with SmartGit
==========================
All Platforms:
--------------
* Some accelerators like Del or Backspace should not be used because they prevent
  the same shortcuts in text fields:

Mac OS X
--------
* SmartGit does not react on dock icon clicks because SWT does not support it:
  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=358376
* When the toolbar is hidden and the full-screen option is toggled, it can
  become visible again, but remains empty:

Linux
-----
* Adding buttons with certain texts (especially Save Stash, Drop Stash, Check Out, 
  Cherry-Pick) to the toolbar makes the latter very wide:

  The work-around is to either not include these items or to unselect the
  "Show text below icon" checkbox in Edit|Customize.

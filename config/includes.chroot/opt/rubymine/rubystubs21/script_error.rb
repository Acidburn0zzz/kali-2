# ScriptError is the superclass for errors raised when a script
# can not be executed because of a +LoadError+,
# +NotImplementedError+ or a +SyntaxError+. Note these type of
# +ScriptErrors+ are not +StandardError+ and will not be
# rescued unless it is specified explicitly (or its ancestor
# +Exception+).
